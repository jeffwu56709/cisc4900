## Phase 3 of this Project.
In this phase, I will add user permissions to certain web pages. There will be a total of 4 types of users: Guests, Customers, Employees, and Admins. 
- Guests will be able to browse items, but can only add them to a Cart and create orders as a Customer. 
- Employees will be able to view the User and Inventory database. They will also have access to the Order System, allowing them to see incoming and past orders. 
- Admins are at the top, with access to everything previously mentioned, but will have Item and User adding/editing privileges and information on product performance.
